# [fit] Me.
==============
==============
- Sysadmin
- One 'devops', please
- Different problems
- Bigger problems

^ Background in help desk and traditional systems adminsitration. I heard about
this DevOps thing and thought that might yield a fatter paycheck. Once I
digested the words 'cloud' and 'devops' I mostly moved around in different
industries trying new problems, after which I tried finding bigger problems.

# [fit] Hack

^ We are here today to make some things. In short, to create. This is a fairly
overloaded term, so let us marinate for a moment on the definition.

# [fit] Hack on Docker

^ We are here today as we shared mutual interests, maybe we have some cool
ideas for a hackathon project, or maybe you want to get involved with submitted
code to open source projects. Docker Inc. has done a great job in showing us
how to get started, so let us run through a tutorial on how you can get to
contributing.

# [fit] Where & What

^ Let us see where and what we can contribute

---

# [fit] Availabile repositories

- docker/docker
- docker/compose
- docker/machine
- etc...

^ These repos are available for contribution, as well as several more. Not all
Docker repositories use the Go language. Also, each repository has its own
focus area. So, if you are an experienced contributor, think about contributing
to a Docker repository that has a language or a focus area you are familiar
with. If you are new, Docker/docker is probably the best place to start.

## Inline Images

When using the **[inline]** modifier, images automatically centre and fit to the available space.

![inline, left](http://deckset-assets.s3-website-us-east-1.amazonaws.com/colnago2.jpg)

Use **[inline, left]** or **[inline, right]** to move images around. With the text underneath like this, it is the simplest ways to add captions to images.
