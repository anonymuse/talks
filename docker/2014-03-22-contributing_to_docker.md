# [fit] Hack on Docker

^ We are here today as we shared mutual interests, maybe we have some cool
ideas for a hackathon project, or maybe you want to get involved with submitted
code to open source projects. Docker Inc. has done a great job in showing us
how to get started, so let us run through a tutorial on how you can get to
contributing.

# [fit] Where & What

^ Let us see where and what we can contribute

---

# [fit] Availabile repositories

- docker/docker
- docker/compose
- docker/machine
- etc...

^ These repos are available for contribution, as well as several more. Not all
Docker repositories use the Go language. Also, each repository has its own
focus area. So, if you are an experienced contributor, think about contributing
to a Docker repository that has a language or a focus area you are familiar
with. If you are new, Docker/docker is probably the best place to start.

^ Keep in mind that not all Docker repos use go, so you may want to consider contributing to a repository that has a language or focus that you are familiar with.
